# Tile
The Pivotal (now VMWare Tanzu) tile eases service broker configuration from within Pivtoal/VMware Tanzu OpsManager.

# Service Broker
The cloud foundry service broker facilitates use of Identity Gateway as a Cloud Foundry Route Service as a fully brokered service (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html#fully-brokered).
