# Tile
The Pivotal (now VMWare Tanzu) tile eases service broker configuration from within Pivtoal/VMware Tanzu OpsManager.

# Service Broker
The service broker for cloud foundry facilitates use of Identity Gateway as a Cloud Foundry Route Service as a fully brokered service (https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/services/route-services.html#fully-brokered).

Source code of the service broker is available (under CDDL licence) at
https://stash.forgerock.org/projects/CLOUD/repos/cloudfoundry-service-broker/browse/service-broker
